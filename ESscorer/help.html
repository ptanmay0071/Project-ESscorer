You can start a match when you are on the ground or in advance.

For an cricket match, you need to select two teams, respective Playing XI, enter number of overs, location, ground, and type of match. For a tournament match, you need to select “Tournament Name” and round in the first step. Optionally, you can also select Match Officials in the first step.

We are constantly improving this workflow so things may change here and there but it will always be pretty much self-explanatory.
